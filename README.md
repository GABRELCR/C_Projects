## 📌 About

`C_Projects` is a **personal C development lab**, where I combine **formal coursework** with **independent experimentation**.
It includes organized class modules (`projetosC/`) and additional folders for free-form exploration — ideal for testing syntax, deepening memory management skills, and building muscle memory with raw C code.

## 📘 projetosC – Course Module

This folder contains 8 structured lessons based on an introductory C programming course.
Topics range from basic syntax to multi-file projects and file handling.

| Lesson | Topic                                                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aula 1 | Introduction to the C Language                                 |
| Aula 2 | Arrays and Matrices                                            |
| Aula 3 | Structs and Data Organization                                  |
| Aula 4 | Pointers and Dynamic Memory                                    |
| Aula 5 | Enum Types, Recursion, and Advanced Pointer Logic              |
| Aula 6 | File Handling (reading, writing, file pointers)                |
| Aula 7 | Multi-file Program Structure                                   |
| Aula 8 | Input Buffer Management (`scanf`, `gets`, and input anomalies) |

## 🧰 Requirements

* GCC or any standard C compiler
* Text editor or IDE (VSCode, CLion, Sublime, etc.)
* Basic terminal or command-line experience

---

## 🚀 Compile & Run

To compile any C file manually:

```bash
gcc file_name.c -o output_name
./output_name
```

Inside course folders, follow naming conventions like `aula2_vetores.c`, `aula4_ponteiros.c`, etc.

## 🧠 In Progress

This repository will grow with additional labs focused on:

* Data structures built from scratch
* Advanced file handling
* Low-level debugging practices
* Modular C programs for real-world tasks

## ☕ Thanks

* To the C legends before me
* To my professors and docs who held the torch
* And to the `gdb` debugger — because printf() can only take you so far
